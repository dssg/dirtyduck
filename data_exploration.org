** Loading data to the database
   Assuming that you are already inside =bastion=, run the following

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/ :results raw drawer
     psql ${FOOD_DB_URL} -c 'select count(*) from inspections'
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   :RESULTS:
    count
   --------
    162039
   (1 row)

   :END:

   (If you are connected to the database, you could just type =select count(*) from inspections=

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/
     psql ${FOOD_DB_URL} -c "\copy inspections FROM '/data/inspections.csv' WITH HEADER CSV"
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : COPY 162039


   This is different to the number of rows that we calculated
   previously. The reason is that the columns =violations= contains
   several lines in some examples. But don't worry, the previous
   command took care about that.

   Let's glimpse the data

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/ :results org drawer
     psql ${FOOD_DB_URL} -c 'select * from inspections limit 5'
   #+END_SRC

   Checking the documentation (located  [[https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/assets/BAD5301B-681A-4202-9D25-51B2CAE672FF?download=true][here]]),

   The meaning of some columns is the following:

   - Risk category of facility:: Each establishment is categorized as
     to its risk of adversely affecting the public’s health, with 1
     being the highest and 3 the lowest. The frequency of
     inspection is tied to this risk, with risk 1 establishments
     inspected most frequently and risk 3 least frequently.

   - Inspection type:: An inspection can be one of the following
     types: canvass, the most common type of inspection performed
     at a frequency relative to the risk of the   establishment;
     consultation, when the inspection is  done at the request of the
     owner prior to the opening of the establishment; complaint, when
     the inspection is done in    response to a complaint against the
     establishment; license, when the inspection is done    as a
     requirement for the establishment to receive its license to
     operate; suspect food    poisoning, when the inspection is done
     in response to one or more persons claiming to    have gotten ill
     as a result of eating at the establishment (a specific type of
     complaint-   based inspection); task-force inspection, when an
     inspection of a bar or tavern is done.    Re-inspections can
     occur for most types of these inspections and are indicated as
     such.

   -  Results:: An inspection can pass, pass with conditions or
     fail. Establishments receiving a ‘pass’ were found to have no
     critical or serious violations (violation number 1-14 and 15-29,
     respectively). Establishments receiving a ‘pass  with conditions’
     were found to have critical or serious violations, but these were
     corrected during the inspection. Establishments receiving a
     ‘fail’ were found to have critical or serious violations that
     were not correctable during the inspection. An establishment
     receiving a ‘fail’ does not  necessarily mean the establishment’s
     licensed is suspended. Establishments found to be out of business
     or not located are indicated as such.

   - Violations: An establishment can receive one or more of 45
     distinct violations (violation numbers 1-44 and 70). For each
     violation number listed for a given establishment, the
     requirement the establishment must meet in order for it to NOT
     receive a violation is noted, followed by a specific description
     of the findings that caused the violation to be issued.


   From this definitions, we can deduct the following claims:

1. /risk/ is related to the frequency of inspections of type /canvass/.
2. /consultation/ is a compulsory inspections /before/ the facility opens
   (so we can remove it from the data), the same happens with /license/.
3. /complaint/ and /suspect food poisoning/ inspections are triggered by
   the people, /consultation/ is triggered by the owner of the
   facility.
4. /task-force/ occurs against bar or taverns.
5. *Critical violations* are coded between =1-14=, *serious violations*
   between =15-29=. So, we can assume that the violations code =30= and
   onward are /minor/ violations.
6. They are only three possible results of the inspection (plus the
   fact that the facility was not located or out of business).


Let's check that we have *only* three different classifications for the
=risk= of the facility and 5 types of =types= of inspections:


#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select distinct risk from inspections;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
| risk            |
|-----------------|
| [NULL]          |
| All             |
| Risk 1 (High)   |
| Risk 2 (Medium) |
| Risk 3 (Low)    |
:END:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select count(distinct type) from inspections
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
| count |
|-------|
|   108 |
:END:

#+BEGIN_SRC  sql
  select distinct results from inspections
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
| results              |
|----------------------|
| Fail                 |
| Pass w/ Conditions   |
| No Entry             |
| Not Ready            |
| Out of Business      |
| Business Not Located |
| Pass                 |
:END:

Ok, disheartening. But, that is the reality of /real/ data. In the next
section we will try to clean this mess.


** Transforming the data

   For tackling a Machine Learning problem you need to identify the
   *entities* of your problem domain, and if your problem involves time,
   how those entities change over time.

   In this tutorial, we have two different goals: (1) an *EIS* and
   (2) *prioritize inspections*, the entity in which we are interested in
   both cases is the  /facility/.

   In the *EIS*, as a facility owner or manager, we want to predict if
   the facility under our control is at /risk/ of been inspected in the
   following period of time.

   In the *inspections prioritization*, we want to generate a list of
   facilities which are /likely/ to have some *critical* o *serious*
   violation /given that/ they are inspected.

   Both problems are under the umbrella of the /supervised machine
   learning/ problems. That means that we must need examples that
   specify the *outcome* in which are interested (in the ML jargon this
   is called a /label/).

   The *outcome* is what differ between those two projects. For *EIS* the
   outcome is *inspected*, for *Inspections*, the outcome is *major violation found*.

   One of the golden rules -that will make your life easier- is:

   /You can't change your original data/

   The reason for this is, if you make some mistake, or if you want to
   try a different thing you will always can go back to the beginning and
   start over.

   Let's see the data to figure out how we need to be transform it.

   Remember that the data that we have is one inspection per row.

   We will check the result of the inspections:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sql
     select
     results, count(*) as total_number
     from
     inspections
     group by
     results
     order by total_number desc;
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   :RESULTS:
   | results              | total_number |
   |----------------------+-------------|
   | Pass                 |       95039 |
   | Fail                 |       31366 |
   | Pass w/ Conditions   |       15363 |
   | Out of Business      |       14473 |
   | No Entry             |        4767 |
   | Not Ready            |         971 |
   | Business Not Located |          60 |
   :END:

   We will remove =Not Ready=, =No Entry=, =Out of Business= and =Business Not Located=
   from the data, and We will only keep all the other options (=Fail=, =Pass w/Condition= and
   =Pass)=.


   We still need to clean the column =type= (it contains several
   variations instead of the seven mentioned in the documentation:
   /canvass/, /complaint/, /license/, /re-inspection/, /task-force/, /consultation/
   and /suspect food poisoning/). For simplicity, we will use /regular
   expressions/ and we will ignore /re-inspection/.


   We will add the following columns in =cleaned.inspections=
   - year
   - month
   - day of week
   - is_weekend
   - week_of_year
   - quarter

   We will remove superfluous spaces and will transform the test to
   lower case, also, we will clean =risk= and we will convert =location= to a
   real =Point=.

#+begin_src sql
select state, count(*) from inspections group by state
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
| state  |  count |
|--------+--------|
| [NULL] |     20 |
| IL     | 162019 |
:END:


   We will drop the columns =state=, =latitude=, =longitude=, since these are
   redundant.

   We will create a new =schema=

   #+BEGIN_SRC sql
     create schema if not exists cleaned
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sql :tangle ./src/create_cleaned_inspections_table.sql
     drop table if exists cleaned.inspections cascade;

   Note that this column is structured in the following form:

   - If there are several violations reported, those violations will
     be separated by ='|'=
   - Every violation begins with a code and  a description
   - Every violation could have *comments*, those comments appear after
     the string =- Comments:=

   We will take that observations in account and create a new table
   called =cleaned.violations= to store

   - inspection
   - code
   - description
   - comments

   #+BEGIN_SRC sql :tangle ./src/create_violations_table.sql

   This code is in =/code/create_violations_table.sql=, you can execute
   this as before.

   As we will see through all this tutorial, /data is always messy/, to
   begin with we have several different spellings (e.g. =SUBWAY= and
   =Subway=, =MCDONALDS= and =MC DONALD'S=, =DUNKIN DONUTS/BASKIN ROBBINS= and
   =DUNKIN DONUTS / BASKIN ROBBINS=, etc)

   We could try a very simple cleaning for example, convert all the
   names to uppercase, remove the trailing spaces, remove the apostrophe
   "='"= and remove the spaces around "=/=". The problem with this approach
   is that we will be fixing the names that we just saw, but there are
   several other nuances down that list. Another approach is use [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/fuzzystrmatch.html][soundex]],
   but that will create a lot of mismatches. The real workaround is apply
   some /machine learning/ to /deduplicate/ the entities [fn:3].  We wont
   follow that path here.


   If we go back to the columns of the table, maybe there is another way
   to solve this: we could try with the column =license_num=  (assume that one
   license represents one establishment) and the column =address= (assume that one restaurant is
   in one place).


   #+BEGIN_SRC sql
     select
     count(distinct facility) as total_facilities,
     count(distinct license_num) as total_licenses,
     count(distinct address) as total_addresses

   This doesn't look promising...

   /What are the top 5 locations with more inspections?/

   #+BEGIN_SRC sql
     select
     address, count(*) as total_inspections,
     coalesce( count(*) filter (where result = 'fail'), 0)
     as total_failures
     from cleaned.inspections
     group by address
     order by total_inspections desc
     limit 5;
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   :RESULTS:
   | address           | total_inspections | total_failures |
   |-------------------+------------------+---------------|

   | 131 n clinton st  |              276 |            34 |
   :END:

   The /location hypothesis/ also has problems, in particular could be *more*
   than one establishment per location (the first row is *O'Hare International Airport*)

   So, our last hope is the /license number/

   We could get, even more information if we check /How many of those inspections result in a 'fail'/?

   /What are the top 5 licenses with more inspections?/

   the way to go, for the identification of the establishments.
