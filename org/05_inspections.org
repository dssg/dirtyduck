* Inpection prioritization
** Problem description

 We will begin with the *inspection prioritization* problem. We want to generate a list of
   facilities that will have a *critical* or *serious* food violation /if/ inspected.

The scenario is the following: you work for the City of Chicago and you have
  limited food inspectors, so you try to prioritize them to focus on the highest-risk
  facilities. So you will use the data to answer the next question:

#+begin_quote
Which X facilities are most likely to fail a food inspection in the
  following Y period of time?
#+end_quote

If you want to focus on major violations only, you can do that too:

#+begin_quote
Which X facilities are most likely to have a critical or serious
  violation in the following Y period of time?
#+end_quote


** Creating the labels

We will define two labels:

- *Which facilities are likely to fail an inspection?*

The label takes a 1 if the inspection had at least one =result= = ='fail'= and a 0 otherwise.

- *Which facilities fail an inspection with a major violation?*

Critical violations are coded between =1-14=, serious violations between
=15-29=, everything above =30= is assumed to be a minor violation.
The label takes a 1 if the inspection had at least one =result= = ='fail'= and a
violation between 1 and 29, and a 0 otherwise.

We can extract the severity of the violation using the
following code:


#+begin_src sql
select
    event_id,
    entity_id,
    date,
    result,
    array_agg(distinct obj ->>'severity') as violations_severity,
    (result = 'fail') as failed,
    coalesce(
    (result = 'fail' and
        ('serious' = ANY(array_agg(obj ->> 'severity')) or 'critical' = ANY(array_agg(obj ->> 'severity')))
        ), false
    ) as failed_major_violation
from
    (
    select
        event_id,
        entity_id,
        date,
        result,
        jsonb_array_elements(violations::jsonb) as obj
    from
        semantic.events
        limit 20
        ) as t1
group by
    entity_id, event_id, date, result
order by
    date desc;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Remember from the section [[Cohorts, labels, event dates and as of dates][Cohorts, labels, event dates and as of dates]] that the /outcome/ will be used by
=triage= to generate the labels. The following image tries to
show the meaning of the /outcomes/ for the /inspection failed/ problem definition.

#+NAME: fig:outcomes-inspections
#+CAPTION: The image shows three facilities and, next to each, a temporal line with 6 days (0-5). Each dot represents an inspection. Green means the facility passed the inspection, and red means it failed. Each facility in the image had two inspections, but only the facility in the middle passed both.

** Modeling Using Machine Learning

It is time to put these steps together. All the coding is complete
(=triage= dev team did that for us); we just need to modify the =triage=
configuration file.

*** Defining a baseline

As a first step, lets do an experiment that defines our
/baseline/. The rationale of this is that the knowing the /baseline/ will
allow us to verify if our Machine Learning model is better than the
baseline.  It is also very fast to train ( =DummyClassifier= is not
computationally expensive, so it will
help us to verify that the experiment configuration is correct without
waiting for a long time)

We need to write the experiment config file for that. Let's break it
down and explain the sections.

The config file for this first experiment is located in
[[./triage/experiments/inspections_baseline.yaml][triage/experiments/inspections_baseline.yaml]].

The first lines of the experiment config file specify the
config-file version (=v6= at the moment of writing this tutorial),
a comment (=model_comment=, which will end up as
a value in the =model_metadata.models= table), and a list of user-defined
metadata (=user_metadata=) that can help to identify the
resulting model groups. For this example, if you run experiments that share
a temporal configuration but that use different label definitions
(say, labeling inspections with *any* violation as positive versus
only labeling inspections with major violations as positive),
you can use the user metadata keys to indicate that the matrices
from these experiments have different labeling criteria. The matrices from the
two experiments will have different filenames (and should not be overwritten or
incorrectly used), and if you add the =label_definition= key to
the =model_group_keys=, models made on different label definitions will
belong to different model groups.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/inspections_baseline.yaml
config_version: 'v6'

model_comment: 'inspections: baseline'

  - 'org'
  - 'team'
  - 'author'
  - 'purpose'
  - 'etl_date'


#+END_SRC

(Obviously, change ='Your name here'= for your name)

Next comes the *temporal configuration* section. The first four parameters
are related to the availability of data: How much data you have for
feature creation? How much data you have for label generation? For
simplicity we will assume that we can use the full =semantic.events= time
span for both.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
select min(date), max(date) from semantic.events
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
|        min |        max |
|------------+------------|
| 2010-01-04 | 2019-02-20 |
:END:

The next parameters are related to the training intervals:
- How frequently to retrain models? (=model_update_frequency=)
- How many rows per entity in the train matrices?
  (=training_as_of_date_frequencies=)
- How much time is covered by labels in the training matrices? (=training_label_timespans=)

The remaining elements are related to the *testing* matrices.
For *inspections*, you can choose them as follows:

- =test_as_of_date_frequencies= is planning/scheduling frequency
- =test_durations= how far ahead do you schedule inspections?
- =test_label_timespan= is equal to =test_durations=

Let's assume that we need to do rounds of inspections every month
(=test_as_of_date_frequencies = 1month=) and we need to complete that
round in exactly one month (=test_durations = test_label_timespan =
1month=).

We will assume that the data is more or less stable[fn:1], at least for one
year, so =model_update_frequency= = =1 year.=

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/inspections_baseline.yaml
temporal_config:
    feature_start_time: '2010-01-04'
    feature_end_time: '2019-01-01'
    label_start_time: '2015-02-01'
    label_end_time: '2019-01-01'

    model_update_frequency: '1y'
    training_label_timespans: ['1month']
    training_as_of_date_frequencies: '1month'

    test_durations: '1y'
    test_label_timespans: ['1month']
    test_as_of_date_frequencies: '1month'

    max_training_histories: '5y'
#+END_SRC

We can visualize the splitting using the function =show-timechop=
introduced in [[file:04_triage_intro.org::*Temporal%20crossvalidation][Introduction to triage]]

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/triage :results silent

# Remember to run this in bastion  NOT in your laptop shell!
triage experiment experiments/inspections_baseline.yaml --show-timechop
#+END_SRC

[[file:triage/images/inspections_baseline.png]]

We need to specify our labels. For this first
experiment we will use the label =failed=, using the same query from the
=simple_skeleton_experiment.yaml=

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/inspections_baseline.yaml
label_config:
  query: |
    select
    entity_id,
    bool_or(result = 'fail')::integer as outcome
    from semantic.events
    where '{as_of_date}'::timestamp <= date
    and date < '{as_of_date}'::timestamp + interval '{label_timespan}'
    group by entity_id
  name: 'failed_inspections'
#+END_SRC

We just want to include *active* facilities in our matrices, so we tell
=triage= to take that in account:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/inspections_baseline.yaml
cohort_config:
  query: |
    select entity_id
    from semantic.entities
    where
    daterange(start_time, end_time, '[]') @> '{as_of_date}'::date
  name: 'active_facilities'
#+END_SRC

=Triage= will generate the features for us, but we need to tell it which features
we want in the section =feature_aggregations=. Here, each entry describes a
=collate.SpacetimeAggregation= object and the
arguments needed to create it. For this experiment, we will use only
one feature (number of inspections). =DummyClassifier= don't use any
feature to do the "prediction", so we won't expend compute cycles
doing the feature/matrix creation:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/inspections_baseline.yaml
feature_aggregations:
  -
    prefix: 'inspections'
    from_obj: 'semantic.events'
    knowledge_date_column: 'date'

    aggregates_imputation:
      count:
        type: 'zero_noflag'

    aggregates:
      -
        quantity:
          total: "*"
        metrics:
          - 'count'

    intervals: ['all']

    groups:
      - 'entity_id'

feature_group_definition:
   prefix:
     - 'inspections'

feature_group_strategies: ['all']
#+END_SRC

If we observe the image generated from the =temporal_config= section,
each particular date is the beginning of the rectangles that describes
the rows in the matrix. In that date (=as_of_date= in =timechop= parlance)
we will calculate both features, and we will repeat that for every
other rectangle in that image.

Now, let's discuss how we will specify the models to try
(remember that the model is specified by the algorithm, the
hyperparameters, and the subset of features to use). In =triage= you
need to specify in the =grid_config= section a list of machine learning
algorithms that you want to train and a list of
hyperparameters. You can use any algorithm that you want; the only
requirement is that it respects the =sklearn= API.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/inspections_baseline.yaml
grid_config:
    'sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier':
        strategy: [prior,uniform, most_frequent]
#+END_SRC

Finally, we should define wich metrics we care about for evaluating our
model. Here we will concentrate only in =precision= and =recall=.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/inspections_baseline.yaml
scoring:
    testing_metric_groups:
        -
          metrics: [precision@, recall@]
          thresholds:
            percentiles: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100]
            top_n: [1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000]

    training_metric_groups:
      -
        metrics: [accuracy]
      -
        metrics: [precision@, recall@]
        thresholds:
          percentiles: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100]
          top_n: [1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000]
#+END_SRC

You should be warned that precision and recall at $k$ in this setting
is kind of ill-defined (because you will end with a lot of =NULL=
labels, remember, only a few of facilities are inspected in each
period)[fn:2].

We will want a *list* of facilities to
be inspected. The length of our list is constrained by our inspection
resources, i.e. the answer to the question /How many facilities can I
inpect in a month?/ In this experiment we are assuming that the
maximum capacity is *50* but we are testing also for a list of length
*5*, and *10* (see =top_n= above).

The execution of the experiments can take a long time, so it is a
good practice to /validate/ the configuration file /before/ running
the model. You don't want to wait for hours (or days) and then
discover that something went wrong.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/ :results silent

# Remember to run this in bastion  NOT in your laptop shell!
triage experiment experiments/inspections_baseline.yaml  --validate-only
#+END_SRC

If everything was ok, you should see an =Experiment validation ran to completion with no errors=.

You can execute the experiment as[fn:3]

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/ :results silent
# Remember to run this in bastion  NOT in your laptop shell!
triage experiment --matrix-format hdf experiments/inspections_baseline.yaml --profile
#+END_SRC

This will print a lot of output, and if everything is correct it will
create *6* matrices (3 for
training, 3 for testing) in =triage/matrices= and every matrix will be
represented by two files, one with the metadata of the matrix (a
=yaml= file) and one with the actual matrix (the =h5= file).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/triage :results raw drawer

# We will use some bash magic

ls matrices | awk -F . '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
      6 h5
      6 yaml
:END:

=Triage= also will store *9* trained models in =triage/trained_models=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/triage :results raw drawer
ls trained_models | wc -l
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
9
:END:

And it will populate the =results= schema in the database. As
mentioned, we will get *3* /model groups/:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
select
    model_group_id,
    model_type,
    hyperparameters
from
    model_metadata.model_groups;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
| model_group_id | model_type                     | hyperparameters              |

|            3 | sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier | {"strategy": "most_frequent"} |
:END:


And *9* /models/:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
select
    model_group_id,
    array_agg(model_id) as models,
    array_agg(train_end_time) as train_end_times
from
    model_metadata.models
group by
    model_group_id
order by
    model_group_id
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
| model_group_id | models  | train_end_times                                                       |
|--------------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|            1 | {1,4,7} | {"2015-12-01 00:00:00","2016-12-01 00:00:00","2017-12-01 00:00:00"} |
|            2 | {2,5,8} | {"2015-12-01 00:00:00","2016-12-01 00:00:00","2017-12-01 00:00:00"} |
|            3 | {3,6,9} | {"2015-12-01 00:00:00","2016-12-01 00:00:00","2017-12-01 00:00:00"} |
:END:

From that last query, you should note that the order in which =triage= trains
the models is from oldest to newest =train_end_time= and
=model_group= , also in ascending order. It will not go to the
next block until all the /models groups/ are trained.

You can check with which matrix the models are trained:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
select
    model_group_id,
    model_id, train_end_time,
    substring(model_hash,1,5) as model_hash,
    substring(train_matrix_uuid,1,5) as train_matrix_uuid,
    ma.num_observations as observations,
    ma.lookback_duration as feature_lookback_duration,  ma.feature_start_time
from

    join
    model_metadata.matrices as ma
    on train_matrix_uuid = matrix_uuid
order by

:END:

As expected, we have three models per model group. Each model was trained
with the matrix indicated in the column =train_matrix_uuid=. This =uuid=
is the file name of the stored matrix. The model itself was
stored under the file named with the =model_hash=.

If you want to see in which matrix the model was /tested/ you need to
run the following query


#+BEGIN_SRC  sql
select distinct
    model_id,
    model_group_id, train_end_time,
    substring(model_hash,1,5) as model_hash,

The columns =num_labeled_examples, num_labeled_above_threshold,
num_positive_labels= represent the number of selected entities on the
prediction date that are labeled, the
number of entities with a positive label above the threshold, and the
number of entities with positive labels among all the
labeled entities  respectively.

*** Creating a simple experiment: ML as a Data Mining technique

For the first experiment we will try one of the simplest
machine learning algorithms: a *Decision Tree Classifier* (/DT/)
The rationale of this is that the DT is very fast to train (so it will
help us to verify that the experiment configuration is correct without
waiting for a long time) and it helps you
to understand the structure of your data.

The config file for this first experiment is located in
[[./triage/experiments/inspections_dt.yaml]]

Note that we don't modify the =temporal_config= section neither the
=feature_aggregations=, =cohort_config= or =label_config=. Triage is smart
enough to use the previous tables and matrices instead of generating
them from scratch.

Note that we don't modify the =temporal_config= section neither the
=cohort_config= or =label_config=. Triage is smart
enough to use the previous tables and matrices instead of generating
them from scratch.

For this experiment, we will add the following features:

- Number of different types of inspections the facility had in the last year
  (calculated for an as-of date).

- Number of different types of inspections that happened in the
  zip code in the last year from a particular day.

- Number of inspections

- Number/proportion of inspections by result type

- Number/proportion of times that a facility was classify with particular risk level

In all of them we will do the aggregation in the last month, 3 months,
6 months, 1 year and historically. Remember
that all this refers to events in the past, i.e. /How many times the facility was marked with high risk in the previous 3 Months?/,
/What is the proportion of failed inspections in the previous year?/

Some of the parameters in =sklearn= are =None=. If you want to try those
you need to indicate it with =yaml='s =null= or =~= keyword.

Besides the algorithm and the hyperparameters, you should specify
which subset of features use. First, in the section
=feature_group_definition= you specify how to group the features (you
can use the =table name= or the =prefix= from the section
=feature_aggregation=) and then a /strategy/ for choosing the
subsets: =all= (all the subsets at once), =leave-one-out= (try all the
subsets except one, do that for all the combinations), or =leave-one-in=
(just try subset at the time).

Note that at the top of the list (sorted by =score=), the /labels/
are =NULL=. This means that the facilities that you are classifying as
high risk, actually weren't inspected in that /as of date/. So, you
actually don't know if this is a correct prediction or not.

This is a *characteristic* of all the resource optimization problems:
You do not have all the information about the elements in your system[fn:5].

So, how the precision/recall is calculated? The number that is show in
the =evaluations= table is calculated using only the rows that have a
non-null label. You could argue that this is fine, if you assume that
the distribution of the label in the non-observed facilities is the
same that the ones that were inspected that month[fn:4]. We will come
back to this problem in the Early Warning problem.

There is a second problem: /How do you break ties in the score?/
If you run the previous query you will see why. The order within all
the equal scores will be /random/. This again will affect the
calculation of your metrics. One potential solution to this is
calculate the metric in the /best case scenario/ (all the true labels are at
the top), and then in the /worst case scenario/ (all the true labels are
at the bottom) and then calculate the metric several times with the
labels shuffled, so you get the /mean/ metric, plus some confidence
intervals. This second problem is *not* specific of an inspection
problem, is more related to simple models like a shallow Decision Tree
or a Dummy Classifier.

*** A more advanced experiment

As before, we can check the temporal structure of our crossvalidation:

# Remember to run this in bastion  NOT in your laptop shell!

We want to use all the features groups
(=feature_group_definition=). The training will be made on matrices
with =all= the feature groups, then leaving one feature group out at a time,
=leave-one-out= (i.e. one model with =inspections= and =results=, another with
=inspections= and =risks=, and another with =results= and =risks), and finally
leaving one feature group in at a time (i.e. a model with =inspections= only,
another with =results= only, and a third with =risks= only).

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/inspections_label_failed_01.yaml

#+END_SRC

Finally, we will try some =RandomForestClassifier=:

#+END_SRC

Before running, let's verify the configuration file

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/ :results silent

# Remember to run this in bastion  NOT in your laptop shell!
triage experiment experiments/inspections_label_failed_01.yaml  --validate-only
#+END_SRC

You can execute the experiment with

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/ :results silent
# Remember to run this in bastion  NOT in your laptop shell!
triage experiment --matrix-format hdf experiments/inspections_label_failed_01.yaml --no-save-predictions --profile
#+END_SRC

This will take a looooong time to run. The reason for that is easy to understand: We are computing
a /lot/ of models: 3 time splits, 4 model groups and 9 features sets (one for =all=, four for =leave_one_in= and
four for =leave_one_out=), so $3 \times 4 \times 9 = 108$ extra models.

Well, now we have a lot of models. How can you pick the best one? You
could try the following query:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
with features_groups as (
select
    model_group_id,
    split_part(unnest(feature_list), '_', 1) as feature_groups
from
    model_metadata.model_groups

features_arrays as (
select
    model_group_id,
    array_agg(distinct feature_groups) as feature_groups

group by
    model_group_id
)

select
    model_group_id,
    model_type,
    hyperparameters,
    feature_groups,
    array_agg(model_id) as models,

    array_agg(to_char(value, '0.999') order by train_end_time asc) as "precision@10%"
from
    model_metadata.models
    join
    features_arrays using(model_group_id)
    join
    test_results.evaluations using(model_id)
where
    model_comment ~ 'inspection'
    and
    metric || parameter = 'precision@10_pct'

This table summarizes all our experiments, but it is very difficult to
use if you want to choose the best combination of hyperparameters and
algorithm (i.e. the model group). In the =postmodeling= section we will
solve this dilemma with the support of =audition=.

* Footnotes

[fn:5] From a more mathematical point of view: Your data actually
reflects the empirical probability: $P(violation|inspected)$, i.e. the
probability of find a violation given that the facility is
inspected. But the probability that you want is $P(violation)$ (yes, I
know that there are no such things as unconditional probabilities,
please bare with me),i.e. the probability that the facility is in violation.

[fn:4] You should see that this assumption is very dangerous in other
settings, for example, crime prediction.

[fn:3] The flags =-no-save-predictions= and =profile= are not necessary
but useful. The first one configure triage to not store the
predictions (at this stage you don't need them, and you can always
could recreate them from the model and the matrix). This will save you
execution time. The flag =profile= stores the /execution/ profile times
in a file, so you can check which models or matrices are taking a lot
of time on been built.

[fn:2] We will explore how to one way to tackle this in the advance part of this tutorial.

[fn:1] You need to check this! Fortunately, =triage= allows you to try
several options here, so, if you think that this is too high or too
low you can change that and fit your needs.
