* Scaling out: AWS Batch

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If your laptop choked in the previous sections or if you can't afford
to look your laptop just lagging forever, you should read this section...
#+END_QUOTE

For bigger experiment, one option is use =[[https://aws.amazon.com/batch/][AWS Batch]]=. AWS Batch
dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute
resources based on the specific resource requirements of the tasks
submitted. AWS Batch will manage (i.e. plans, schedules, and executes)
the resources (CPU, Memory) that we need to run the pipeline. In other
words, AWS Batch will provide you with a computer (an AWS EC2 machine)
that satisfies your computing requirements, and then it will execute
the software that you intend to run.

AWS Batch dependes in other two technologies in order to work: Elastic
Container Registry (Amazon ECR) as the Docker image registry (allowing
AWS Batch to fetch the task images), and Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon
EC2) instances located in the cluster as the docker host (allowing AWS
Batch to execute the task).

An AWS ECS task will be executed by an EC2 instance belonging to the
ECS cluster (if there are resources available). The EC2 machine
operates as a Docker host: it will run the task definition, download
the appropriate image from the ECS registry, and execute the
container.

** What do you need to setup?

AWS Batch requires setup the following infrastructure:

    - An [[https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc2=h_m1][AWS S3 bucket]] for storing the original data and the successive transformations of it made by the pipeline.
    - A PostgreSQL database (provided by [[https://aws.amazon.com/rds/][AWS RDS]]) for storing the data in a relational form.
    - An Elastic Container Registry ([[https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/][AWS ECR]]) for storing the triage's Docker image used in the pipeline.
    - [[https://aws.amazon.com/batch/][AWS Batch Job Queue]] configured and ready to go.

** Assumptions

    - You have =[[https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/][jq]]= installed
    - You have IAM credentials with permissions to run AWS Batch, read
      AWS S3 and create AWS EC2 machines.
    - You installed =awscli= and configure your credentials following
      the standard instructions.
    - You have access to a S3 bucket:
    - You have a AWS ECR repository with the following form: =dsapp/triage-cli=
    - You have a AWS Batch job queue configured and have permissions
      for adding, running, canceling jobs.


You can check if you have the =AWS S3= permissions like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sh
[AWS_PROFILE=your_profile] aws ls [your-bucket]   # (dont't forget the last backslash)
#+END_EXAMPLE

And for the =AWS Batch= part:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
[AWS_PROFILE=your_profile] aws batch describe-job-queues
[AWS_PROFILE=your_profile] aws batch describe-job-definitions
#+END_SRC


** Configuration

First we need to customize the file =.aws_env= (yes, another environment
file).

Copy the file =aws_env.example= to =.aws_env= and fill the blanks

*NOTE*: Don't include the =s3://= protocol prefix in the =S3_BUCKET=

*** (Local) Environment variables

#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle ../aws_env.example
#!/usr/bin/env bash

PROJECT_NAME=dirtyduck
TRIAGE_VERSION=3.3.0
ENV=development
AWS_REGISTRY={your-ecr-registry}
AWS_JOB_QUEUE={your-job-queue}
POSTGRES_DB={postgresql://user:password@db_server/dbname}
S3_BUCKET={your-bucket}
#+END_SRC

To check if everything is correct you can run:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sh
[AWS_PROFILE=your_profile]  ./deploy.sh -h
#+END_EXAMPLE

Next, we need 3 files for running in AWS Batch, copy the files and remove
the =.example= extension and adapt them to your case:

*** Job definition

Change the =PROJECT_NAME= and =AWS_ACCOUNT= for their real values

 #+BEGIN_SRC json :tangle ../infrastructure/aws_batch/triage-job-definition.json.example
{
  "containerProperties": {
    "command": [
      "--tb",
      "Ref::experiment_file",
      "--project-path",
      "Ref::output_path",
      "Ref::replace",
      "Ref::save_predictions",
      "Ref::profile",
      "Ref::validate"
    ],
    "image": "AWS_ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/YOUR_TRIAGE_IMAGE",
    "jobRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::AWS_ACCOUNT:role/dsappBatchJobRole",
    "memory": 16000,
    "vcpus": 1
  },
  "jobDefinitionName": "triage-cli-experiment",
  "retryStrategy": {
    "attempts": 1
  },
  "type": "container"
}
 #+END_SRC

*** Environment variables overrides (for docker container inside the AWS EC2)

Fill out the missing values

#+BEGIN_SRC json :tangle ../infrastructure/aws_batch/triage-overrides.json.example
{
    "environment": [
        {
            "name":"AWS_DEFAULT_REGION",
            "value":"us-west-2"
        },
        {
            "name":"AWS_JOB_QUEUE",
            "value":""
        },
        {
            "name":"POSTGRES_PASSWORD",
            "value":""
        },
        {
            "name":"POSTGRES_USER",
            "value":""
        },
        {
            "name":"POSTGRES_DB",
            "value":""
        },
        {
            "name":"POSTGRES_PORT",
            "value":""
        },
        {
            "name":"POSTGRES_HOST",
            "value":""
        }
    ]
}
#+END_SRC

*** =credentials-filter=

Leave this file as is (We will use it for storing the temporal token
in =deploy.sh=)

#+BEGIN_SRC json :tangle ../infrastructure/aws_batch/credentials.filter.example
{
        "environment": [
                {
                        "name": "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
                        "value": .Credentials.AccessKeyId
                },
                {
                        "name": "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
                        "value": .Credentials.SecretAccessKey
                },
                {
                        "name": "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN",
                        "value": .Credentials.SessionToken
                }
        ]
}
#+END_SRC


*** Running an experiment

We provided a simple bash file for creating the image,
uploading/updating the job definition and running the experiment:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
    ./deploy.sh -h

    Usage: ./deploy.sh (-h | -i | -u | -b | -r | -a | --sync_{to,from}_s3 )
    OPTIONS:
       -h|--help                   Show this message
       -i|--info                   Show information about the environment
       -b|--update-images          Build the triage image and push it to the AWS ECR
       -u|--update-jobs            Update the triage job definition in AWS Batch
       -r|--run-experiment         Run experiments on chile-dt data
       --sync-to-s3                Uploads the experiments and configuration files to s3://your_project
       --sync-from-s3              Gets the experiments and configuration files from s3://your_project
    EXAMPLES:
       Build and push the images to your AWS ECR:
            $ ./deploy.sh -b
       Update the job's definitions:
            $ ./deploy.sh -u
       Run triage experiments:
            $ ./deploy.sh -r --experiment_file=s3://your_project/experiments/test.yaml,project_path=s3://your_project/triage,replace=--replace
    #+END_EXAMPLE

If you have multiple AWS profiles use =deploy.sh= as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sh
[AWS_PROFILE=your_profile] ./deploy.sh -r [job-run-name] experiment_file=s3://{your_bucket}/experiments/simple_test_skeleton.yaml,output_path=s3://{your_bucket}/triage,replace=--no-replace,save_predictions=--no-save-predictions,profile=--profile,validate=--validate
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where =your_profile= is the name of the profile in =~/.aws/credentials=
