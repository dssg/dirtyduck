* Welcome!

This tutorial will show you how to use =triage=, a data science
 modeling tool developed at the [[http://dsapp.uchicago.edu][Center for Data Science and Public
 Policy]] (DSaPP) at the University of Chicago.

=triage= helps build models for three [[https://dssg.uchicago.edu/data-science-for-social-good-conference-2017/training-workshop-data-science-for-social-good-problem-templates/][common applied problems]]: (a) Early
warning systems (*EWS* or *EIS*), (b) /resource prioritization/ (a.k.a "an
inspections problem") and (c) interaction level predictions (a.k.a
"appointment level"). These problems
are difficult to model because their conceptualization and
and implementation are prone to error, thanks to their multi-dimensional,
multi-entity, time-series structure.

The last version of this tutorial is published in [[https://dssg.github.io/dirtyduck/]]

*NOTE* This tutorial is in sync with the latest version of =triage=. At
this moment [[https://github.com/dssg/triage/releases/tag/v3.2.1][v3.2.1 (Flaming Hot Cheeto)]].

* What you need for this tutorial

Install [[http://www.docker.com][Docker CE]] and [[https://docs.docker.com/compose/][Docker Compose]]. That's it.
Follow the links for installation instructions.

Note that if you are using =GNU/Linux= you should add your user to the
=docker= group following the instructions at this [[https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/][link]].

At the moment only operative systems with *nix-type command lines are
supported, such as =GNU/Linux= and =MacOS=. Recent versions of
=Windows= may also work.

* How to use this tutorial

First, clone this repository on your laptop

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 git clone https://github.com/dssg/dirtyduck.git
#+END_EXAMPLE

Second, copy the file
=infrastructure/env_example= to
=infrastructure/.env=, open the file, and change the
string =your_password= to something more meaningful to you.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sh :tangle infrastructure/env_example
    POSTGRES_DB=food
    POSTGRES_HOST=0.0.0.0
    POSTGRES_USER=food_user
    POSTGRES_DB=food
    POSTGRES_PORT=5434
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password  #<-- change this if you like

    UID=1000
    GID=1000
   #+END_EXAMPLE

Third, run

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./tutorial.sh start
#+END_Example

This will take several minutes the first time you do it.

Finally, open your browser and type [[https://dssg.github.io/dirtyduck/]] into the location bar. That
will open the tutorial. Follow from there[fn:3].

* How you can help

Help is always welcome! You can report errors, improve
the tutorial, or propose improvements to
=triage=. These three cases are discussed below.

** How to report errors

There are almost surely errors. Please open an [[https://github.com/dssg/dirtyduck/issues][issue]] and
we will try to issue a fix as soon as possible.

** How to improve the tutorial

This tutorial was created following the practices of [[https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html][Literate
Programming]] using [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]][fn:1] in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]][fn:2]. That means the tutorial is a /live/ document that mixes code and text.

The steps to help are:

- clone the repository
- edit the source =org= files in the =src= folder
- create a *pull request*.


** How to help develop =triage=

Go to the [[https://github.com/dssg/triage][triage]] repository and follow the instructions there.

* Footnotes

[fn:3] You could also follow this tutorial in github or in your =GNU
Emacs=. Just follow the =org= files inside the folder =src=.

[fn:2] But it is supported in =vim= if you install a plugin.

[fn:1] It's similar to =markdown= so you won't have any problem.
